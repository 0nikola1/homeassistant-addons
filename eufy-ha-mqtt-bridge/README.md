# Home Assistant Add-on: eufy-ha-mqtt-bridge

---
## ðŸš¨ This is some experimental release! ðŸš¨
---

Quick wrapp around https://github.com/matijse/eufy-ha-mqtt-bridge.

Application data will be written to `/share/eufy-ha-mqtt-bridge/` so log and other files can be accessed from other addons, e.g. the `Samba share` addon, or view it at the `Visual Studio Code` add-on.  
ðŸš¨ This also contains some plaintext configuration file with login credentials, so take care who can access your files! ðŸš¨
