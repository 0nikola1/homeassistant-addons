# Home Assistant Add-on: Eufy Home Assistant MQTT Bridge
## Based on https://github.com/matijse/eufy-ha-mqtt-bridge/

---
## ðŸš¨ This is some experimental release! ðŸš¨
---

**The underlaying docker image will be build every night until there is some kind of versioning available.**
**If a feature was released at eufy-ha-mqtt-bridge, it might be available as recently as the next day.**

Quick wrapp around https://github.com/matijse/eufy-ha-mqtt-bridge.

Application data will be written to `/share/eufy-ha-mqtt-bridge/` so log and other files can be accessed from other addons, e.g. the `Samba share` addon, or view it at the `Visual Studio Code` add-on.  

As there is currently no real versioning you might want to hit the `REBUILD` button from time to time, to ensure you got the latest version.

ðŸš¨ This also contains some plaintext configuration file with login credentials, so take care who can access your files! ðŸš¨
