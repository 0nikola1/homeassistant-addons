# Home Assistant Add-on: OctoPrint Proxy

Small _haproxy_ based reverse proxy to have OctoPrint accessible from Home Assistant with a memory consumption less than 10Mbyte.

Works okayish with OctoPi based installations, others not tested. Feedback welcome.

**Remember to enable the _Show in sidebar_ option.**

Webcam (and some other stuff) is not working right now, will fix some day.
