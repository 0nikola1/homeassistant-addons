# Home Assistant Add-on: OctoPrint Proxy

Small *haproxy* based reverse proxy to have OctoPrint accessible from Home Assistant with a memory consumption less than 10Mbyte.

Works great with OctoPi based installations, others not tested. Feedback welcome.

**Remember to enable the *Show in sidebar* option.**

Webcam is not working right now, will fix asap.
